# Caroushow

Caroushow is an app that allows you to create seamless carousel-like posts for your social media. \*

\* Different social media and/or respective apps on different platforms may present multiple images in a single post differently.

## Description

Have you ever had a photo that looks great whether zoomed in or out, but the cropping and resizing on social media stops the audience from appreciating its fine details?

Caroushow helps create contiguous image crops so they still look like one photo when swiped on and looked at up close!
